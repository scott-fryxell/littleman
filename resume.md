# Experience

### Lead Engineer at Savvy
**March 2015 - August 2015 (6 months)**

Savvy, a WebRTC based video streaming service that connects teachers and learners, received its first round of funding within two weeks of my start date. I spent my first three months architecting and building the minimum viable product. The next three months I hired the dev team and we built our beta release.

I designed and built out Savvy's double sided marketplace using Stripe. I integrated Savvy's calendar features into Google Calendar. I built out a front end framework optimized for writing CSS and event driven javascript.

I hired another senior engineer to guarantee consistency and a junior developer to bring us energy and innovation. I focused on creating a mutually supportive team atmosphere while also setting the highest possible standards for development.

Code coverage was at 100% on my last day.

### Salesperson at Vacation
**April 2014 - present (2 years 9 months)**

I took a break from engineering to reconnect with my community. Vacation is a vintage clothing store located in the Tenderloin. I helped with all aspects of operation: from selling clothing and supporting bands, to helping  revitalize the business by working with the owner to increase profits and bring in a business partner. Everything about this store makes me happy; I still help with shows and occasionally work at the store.

### Software Engineer at Tout
**August 2013 - May 2014 (10 months)**

Architected and implemented a publishing rights application. Built a search service based on Lucent, which is able to query over 2 million tracks with result times consistently ten times faster than the existing search system. Created a continuous build system with the help of Maven and Continuum. Leveraged Prototype, Scriptaculous and some of my own event based insanity to focus the middle tier on marshaling data to the client.

### Software Engineer at LRN

Developed cross browser backward and forward compatible User Agent framework based on Tapestry. Designed a client event model that supported multiple event bindings, dynamic component initialization based on custom HTML attributes.

### Software Engineer at NewScale

Worked with offshore developers on best practices for struts, tiles, and general application development. Implemented a development build system that supports deployment to multiple applications servers and operating systems. The build was customizable at appropriate resolutions and ran 500% faster than the previous build system.

Spearheaded the refactor of the user interface to conform to web standards, decreasing page size between thirty to sixty percent, providing for cross-platform browser support, both forward and backwards compatibility, application skinning, global print capabilities, as well as WAP and palm support.

Provided technical support to client engineers, prospective customers, and business partners. Performed onsite installations and integration of application.
