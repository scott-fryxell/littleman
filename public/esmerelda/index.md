# No Mercy

*San Francisco stands like a lighthouse becoming the ships of outsiders to port. From drag to performance art to innumerable music related subcultures San Francisco has long been the epicenter of counter culture . Most notably the birthplace of the hippie movement which rejected the values of 50s America sf was also one of the first cities to embrace the punk movement which rejected the values of the hippie movement. Punk band Noh mercy found itself comfortably on these outskirts of avant garde music scene in San Francisco in the late 70s. Featuring Tony Hotel on drums and Esmeralda on vocals. The band rejected male driven guitar music, their motto was "No Boys On Guitars”. Their sound was characterized but anger and mockery. Esmerelda’s singing style is both aggressive and perforative perhaps having been influenced by her cabaret back round up on first moving to San Francisco. We talked about the growing up in LA, acid, and what it took to come out of her shell.*


**Where did you grow up?**
I grew up right outside of Hollywood in Los Angeles in the San Fernando Valley.
 Until I dropped out of high school and ran away from home.

**Why did you want to leave?**
 I was adopted so I felt like a freak from the moon. At parties, relatives of mine would take me aside and say, “You know we love you, even though you are adopted!” I started dressing really outrageously. I mean really outrageously. In LA you have to look perfect. I gained weight so they sent me to the doctor when I was like twelve and put me on diet pills. Then I was totally wired. So they gave me tranquilizers. This was junior high school. They drugged women a lot back then.

**What were your family like?**
My father drank heavily. Everyone drank in the 50s. I mean Mad Men is real. Everybody chain-smoked and drank even more than they showed on that show. I never knew adults who didn’t drink all the time.

**What was high school like for you?**
I was cutting school and drinking, painting and listening to Thelonious Monk when my parents were at work. I had been really bullied by kids, so I decided to be so weird it would scare kids. I was very goth, I have to say.

**Who did you hang out with?**
There’s always this group of intellectual freaks that are into art and music that are in every high school. Forever. I think that is something from Time immemorial. We were all into reading and writing poetry. But then we discovered LSD.

**Do you remember any of your LSD experiences?**
When I was sixeteen I was in Hollywood one night at a club called the Hullaballoo. You could get into clubs in Hollywood when you were sixteen back then. I met this guy who had a VW bus, his name was Rabbit, and there was another guy and girl and they had pure Sandoz pharmaceutical LSD from Switzerland. I drank the bottle of it, It was very Alice and Wonderland. It became overwhelmingly clear that love was the most important thing in the universe, and just taking good care of yourself and others, which before that was not what I was taught. Creativity was everything. I was “seeking” the whole time, and the LSD experiences really put me in context. I took acid all the time. It was really hard to keep going to high school.

**That’s wild.**

I was still getting honors in high school and I was brilliant at things but I couldn't handle it anymore, so I ran away and got thrown in jail in SF with a bunch of other kids who'd been squatting in this building. My boyfriend and I drove across the country and sold LSD on college campuses in a psych painted hearse, and that’s the truth., I made all of my clothes, I made everything, I made all my jewelry, I didn't wear shoes but the guy I married made a pair of shoes. We didn't stay together very long and we broke up when I was 22.


**Where you really affected by the Haight-Ashbury scene?**
The Haight-Ashbury fell apart really quick, it was incredible, it was a utopian wonderland for about a year, maybe two years.All these really creepy people were starting to come in, people like Charles Manson, it was getting dark. So I left SF and moved to Marin County and I moved into this house. I literally started knocking on doors, saying I need a place to live. One door I knocked on, this girl with a shaved head and huge eyes answered and said “you can live here” and it ended up that she had taken way too much LSD and her father had given her this beautiful house in the country and all these freaks lived there including this girl band called the Ace of Cups.

**What your time in San Fransisco like?**
I began tap dancing and singing and musical theater and then became a nightclub singer got involved in the gay scene in SF. I'm talking about 1973, like 8,000 years ago. We were really into the 20s and 30s and that kind of singing, and all those clothes; beautiful beaded gowns, fur coats, gorgeous stuff in the thrift store that nobody wanted. That stuff, it was like, old. We dressed like that all the time these old beautiful gowns and velvet and feathers oh we looked great really dressed up.

**So was music something that came later?**
I was always into music but I didn't have very good self esteem.

**Could you talk about performance? How did u get into doing cabaret and performing from being so shy?**

Well it was I left my husband, it was women's liberation, and there was this whole thing with women, You have to understand you needed a man to sign checks. If you wanted a credit card a man had to get it for you, and all I was raised to do was get married they never trained me to do anything, and so women really had no power. Women’s liberation, it was hard won, men really turned on you and thought that it was acute, some phase or tried to break you. It was hard. And it was so much to overcome that I think some women especially no take for granted.

I was heartbroken when my marriage ended and I was really upset and angry and doing punk rock really let me let it all out. And it was like therapy to me but it was also funny to me too it didn’t take itself too seriously.

**So was music something that came later?**
I was always into music but I didn't have very good self esteem.

**How did you start playing music?**
I was around all these amazing musicians but I was too afraid to sing, so it wasn't until I got into the gay cabarete scene and I got the confidence and started singing in the early 70s then that all changed, everything changed. Everyone was on welfare and they pulled the money and did free theater and lived in a commune.

 I went from that and went to England and was living with the people that started punk rock with the Sex Pistols so we bought back those records and we overnight went punk ,everyone was cutting everyone's hair off and it was so great, we were really pissed that all our romantic notions and everything that was so beautiful about the 60s just fell apart. The Vietnam War was so hideous and we were all really pissed at the government, so we became punk rockers.

**How did you start Noh Mercy?**
I had this idea for a band that was no guitars, and then I met Tony Hotel, and she was such an amazing drummer that we didn't need anybody else she could do anything I thought up.

**How did you meet her?**
Well, my roommate was stripper and she had a friend who was a stripper and Tony Hotel was her girlfriend. And then she got a crush on me, but I wasn't gay; I just wanted to have this band, but she wore me down!


Was there anything other than music that you used to cope and express yourself
Besides drugs and alcohol? All we did was smoke cigarettes, drink beer and do coke. That was life. We didn’t eat much, to some people died from doing that. I feel very grateful that I didn’t die but it was close, we got really out there.

**When did it all come to an end?**
Well I was at a NY eve party and we were stoned drunk and I was sick of living like this and I had this vision, I was really into mystical things, tarot and all that, and I have this vision that I was going to be needed, and I needed to clean up my act so I could be of service and of help in this time that was coming. And it was like being visited by an angel it was so profound, and it shook me up so much that I immediately started trying to get clean and sober and I ended up leaving and going to Mendocino we here my fam was and I got sober, I’ve been sober 35 years. And what was coming, what the angel was telling me was the AIDS epidemic, so my friend all of whom were gay really started getting sick and dying. Right after I got sober, one after the other, it was really really hard. That was really hard to deal with.

**Do you have any reflections on Noh Mercy?**
It was weird for women to be in music anywhere but our music was so weird. I got fan mail from people and read articles from guys that said it was the scariest thing, they haven’t seen women screaming and raging and it made me so happy that it freaked them out to see women acting like that. It was wild.
