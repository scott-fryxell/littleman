      <p itemprop="description">Savvy, a WebRTC based video streaming service
        that connects teachers and learners, received its first round of funding
        within two weeks of my start date. I spent my first three months
        architecting and building the minimum viable product. The next three
        months I hired the dev team and we built our beta release.</p>
      <p itemprop="description">I designed and built out Savvy's double sided
        marketplace using Stripe. I integrated Savvy's calendar features into
        Google Calendar. I built out a front end framework optimized for writing
        CSS and event driven javascript.</p>
      <p itemprop="description">I hired another senior engineer to guarantee
        consistency and a junior developer to bring us energy and innovation.
        I focused on creating a mutually supportive team atmosphere while also
        setting the highest possible standards for development.</p>

        with the owner to increase profits and bring in a business partner.
        Everything about this store makes me happy; I still help with
        shows and occasionally work at the store.</p>
