      <p itemprop="description">I hired another senior engineer to guarantee
        consistency and a junior developer to bring us energy and innovation.

        setting the highest possible standards for development.</p>

        with the owner to increase profits and bring in a business partner.
        Everything about this store makes me happy; I still help with
        shows and occasionally work at the store.</p>
